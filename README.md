# Deep Learning Reliability Awareness of Converters at the Edge (Deep RACE)
![POWERED BY TeCSAR](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/Deep_RACE/master/logo/tecsarPowerBy.png)

Deep RACE is a real-time reliability modeling and assessment of power semiconductor devices embedded into a wide range of smart power electronics systems. Deep RACE departures from classical learning and statistical modeling to deep learning based data analytics, combined with full system integration for scalable real-time reliability modeling and assessment. In this regard, it leverages the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks as a branch of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to aggregate reliability across many power converters with similar underlying physic. Also, It offers real-time online assessment by selectively combining the aggregated training model with device-specific behaviors in the field.
## Prerequisites
First make sure you have already installed pip3, Tkinter, and git tools:
``` bash
sudo apt install git python3-pip python3-tk
```
You should also install follwoing python packages:
```bash
sudo -H pip3 install tensorflow scipy matplotlib seaborn
```
## Installation
You only need to clone the Deep RACE repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/Deep_RACE
```
## Training the network models
Change the path to the `Deep_RACE` directory and run the `train.py`:
```bash
cd Deep_RACE
./train.py
```

All the training models will be saved automatically in `./inference_models/` folder. You can load them by running `inference.py` file.

### Prediction output
The `./train.py` will generate and save the predition out put in a text file. The file name is based on the selected MOSFET device number. As an instance, a text file with the name of `./prediction_output/res_dev2.txt` will be generated for `dev#2`.

### Testing different MOSFET devices
You can test different devices from `RoIFor5Devs.mat` by altering [this line](https://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/Deep_RACE/blob/68688f2b89a651f0985364c74c2ae949a696338b/train.py#L69) in the `./train.py`.
